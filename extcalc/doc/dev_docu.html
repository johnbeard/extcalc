  <a name="math"><h2>3. Mathematical Functions</h2></a>
  From v0.6.5 on, there are only two classes which can be used to process a calculation. The Calculate class and the Script class.<br>
  The normal calculator and the script interpreter use the script class. The Calculate class is used for graph drawing, function
  tables and function analysis. The console calculator calc only uses the Script class. All mathematical functions and classes
  are located in the global.h and global.cpp source files.
  <a name="math1"> <h3>3.1 Important Basic Functions</h3></a>
  There are several extra functions, that don't belong to any of the calculator classes, which were needed for the parsers.<br>
  This chapter describes them.<br>
  <h4>String Operations: strcut</h4>
  The string operations were used to simplify string modifications in the parser and preprocessor algorithms.<br><br>
  Prototype:<br>
  <pre>char*strcut(char*src,int index,int len=1);</pre><br>
  Description:<br>
  This function cuts out some characters from the given string and returns a pointer to the new string.
  Parameters are the source string, the start index and the number of characters to cut out.<br>
  The returned char pointer represents a newly allocated string, allocated with new.<br>
  
  <h4>String Operations: strins</h4>
  Prototype:<br>
  <pre>char*strins(char*dest,const char*src,int index);</pre><br>
  Description:<br>
  This function inserts the string src into the string dest at position index. It returns a pointer on the result string.
  The memory for the result string is allocated with the new operator inside the function.<br>
  
  <h4>String Operations: strcopy</h4>
  Prototype:<br>
  <pre>int strcopy(char*dest,char*src,int len);</pre><br>
  Description:<br>
  This function copies a part of the length len from src to dest. The dest string must be allocated before calling this function.
  It must be large enough for inserting. If you don't want to copy the string to the start of dest, use for example
  <pre> dest[start_index]</pre> instead of dest.<br>
  
  <h4>Search Functions: bracketFind</h4>
  The search functions are an important part of the parser algorithms, to find the relevant parts of a string.<br><br>
  Prototype:<br>
  <pre>int bracketFind(char* string,char* searchString, int start=0);</pre><br>
  Description:<br>
  This functions searches the string string for the expression searchString. But it searches only outside of brackets.
  It counts the following as brackets: <pre>( [ { "</pre> Only if all found open brackets were closed, it continues 
  searching. It is possible to search for one of the bracket signs. You can also set the search start index.<br>
  
  <h4>Search Functions: bracketFindRev</h4>
  Prototype:<br>
  <pre>int bracketFindRev(char* string,char* searchString, int start=-1);</pre><br>
  Description:<br>
  This function does the same as the function above, but it searches from the end to the start of the string.
  The search start index can also be set. -1 means always start at the end.<br>
  
  <h4>Preprocessor: checkStringAnsi (Calc: checkString)</h4>
  The preprocessor functions process a given input string and replace some operators, insert multiply operators where they are needed,
  and remove whitespace and other things that are not needed for the parser.<br>
  The checkStringAnsi functions is part of Calc and Extcalc, but in Calc it is named checkString. In Extcalc is it called
  checkStringAnsi, because it is written in Ansi-C++ without QT commands. Therefore, Extcalc needs an additional preprocessor
  function, which is called checkString (in Extcalc). This function replaces the Unicode characters through standard ASCII.<br><br>
  Prototype:<br>
  <pre>char* checkStringAnsi(char*calcString,Preferences*pref);</pre><br>
  Description:<br>
  The given parameters are the input string as char pointer and a pointer to the preferences struct.<br>
  Be careful with the return value of this function, because it can be NULL and the parser should not be called with NULL.<br>
  This function works in five steps with five loops.<br>
  The first loop removes whitespace and comments. It returns an error when the string length becomes zero or when it finds the 
  reserved backslash character.<br>
  The second loop replaces some operators (integral, root, ...) through their internal representations. It also replaces
  the engeneering signs, for example n through e-9. Finally, it removes unneeded + und - operators. If calculator mode is
  scientific, lowercase z and x are replaced through uppercase X and Z.<br>
  The third loop inserts all multiply signs that are not written, but for the parser.<br>
  The fourth loop replaces numeric constants (pi and the euler constant) through their numeric values.<br>
  The fourth loop does the same as the third one. That is needed after inserting the constants.<br>
   
  <h4>Preprocessor: checkString (Extcalc only)</h4>
  Prototype:<br>
  <pre>char* checkString(QString calcString,Preferences*pref);</pre><br>
  Description:<br>
  This function replaces unicode characters through ASCII code and runs checkStringAnsi. It returns a pointer to the cleaned string.
  The parameters are a pointer to the Preferences struct (only to give it to checkStringAnsi) and the input string as QString.<br> 
  
  <a name="math2"><h3>3.2 Class Description</h3></a>
  There are two classes which can be used to process mathematical expressions. The Calculate class and the Script class.
  Both classes have the same base class called Math.<br>
  These classes build a tree that represents a matematical expression in the memory.
  Both classes include a parser method that builds the tree. This parser is normally ran by the constructor of the class.<br>
  When the constructer has built an object tree, the expression can be calculated with a second method.
  These method can be ran several times with different values of the variables.<br>
  
  <h4>Math class</h4>
  This class contains some main parts, which are needed for both matematic classes.
  These are the protected variables:
  <pre>
	protected:
	Variable*vars;						//A pointer to the variables vector mainly used by Calculate
	Preferences*pref;					//The preferences struct
	Math*parent;						//A pointer to the parent class
	Math *vertObj,*horzObj;				//two pointers for following classes to build a tree structure
	double number;						//temporary memory for calculations
	int var;							//The index of a variable, if this operation is a variable
	int operation;						//The operation code
   </pre>
   It also contains one non-virtual method:
   <pre>int getOperation()</pre>
   This method returns the operation code of the class.<br>
   
  <h4>Calculate class</h4>
