1. INTRODUCTION
Extcalc is a scientific graphic calculator for linux. It can process difficult
mathmatical functions, draw graphs and work with functions. You can also calculate tables from functions. A Script-Interpreter for programs, written in a C-like language, is also included in Extcalc. 




2. INSTALLATION
- unpack archive (tar -xzf extcalc-0.9.0.tar.gz)
- switch to directory (cd extcalc-0.9.0)
- run configure (./configure)
- compile (make)
- become root (su)
- install (make install)

Languages:
To install the german version of the calculator, type "./configure --enable-language_de" instead of
"./configure"

For the french version, type "./configure --enable-language_fr"

5. IMPORTANT

This is a beta version. The program may have some bugs.

Tested Distributions:

Debian 3.1 Sarge
             The program builds without errors, but if you want to use 
             the graphics window, it is black and you can't draw graphs
             If this happans on your system,  please install the
             updates for X and OpenGL to fix this bug.
             
Fedora Core 4        
             installation runs without errors
             programm stops immediately with segmentation fault 
             The linker of the standard version of FC4 doesn't generate
             a working ELF header for this program.
             To fix this bug, please update gcc and g++.

Software Requirements:
Linux
GCC 3 or GCC 4 (doesn't run with gcc 2.xx)
QT3.1 or higher
OpenGL 

Hardware Requirements:
CPU at about 1GHz (32Bit or 64Bit)
enough RAM to run X
For 3D-graphics, a 3D-graphics card is recommended
A mouse with mousewheel is needed for rotating, moving and zooming graphs


Precision:
The maximal precision of extcalc on a 32Bit-CPU is 18 digits because it uses long double-variables for
calculation.
The precision of integrations is about 9 digits
The precision of differentiations is about 8 digits
At trigonimetric functions and logarithms about 17 digits
