1. INTRODUCTION
Extcalc is a scientific graphic calculator for linux. It can process difficult
mathmatical functions, draw graphs and work with functions. You can also calculate tables from functions. A Script-Interpreter for programs, written in a C-like language, is also includen in Extcalc. 




2. INSTALLATION
- unpack archive (tar -xzf extcalc-0.4.5.tar.gz)
- switch to directory (cd extcalc-0.4.5)
- run configure (./configure)
- compile (make)
- become root (su)
- install (make install)

Languages:
To install the german version of the calculator, type "./configure --enable-language_de" instead of
"./configure"

Configuration:

Ubuntu Linux 5.04
             Installation runs without errors.
             Program starts without errors, but graphics-window doesn't work.
             This is a bug in the X-Server, which has not been fixed.
             Version 5.10 of Ubuntu has fixed this bug.

Debian 3.1 Sarge
             If the same problem exists on Debian 3.1, please install the
             updates for X and OpenGL to fix this bug.
             
Fedora Core 4        
             installation runs without errors
             programm stops immediately with segmentation fault 
             The linker of the standard version of FC4 doesn't generate
             a working ELF header for this program.
             To fix this bug, please update gcc and g++.

Needed software:
Linux
GCC 3 or GCC 4 (doesn't run with gcc 2.xx)
QT3.1 or higher
OpenGL 

Needed hardware:
CPU at about 1GHz (32Bit or 64Bit)
enough RAM to run X
For 3D-graphics, a 3D-graphics card is recommended
A mouse with mousewheel is needed for rotating and zooming 3D-graphs


Precision:
The maximal precision of extcalc on a 32Bit-CPU is 18 digits because it uses long double-variables for
calculation.
The precision of integrations is about 9 digits
The precision of differentiations is about 8 digits
At trigonimetric functions and logarithms about 17 digits
