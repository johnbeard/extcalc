1. INTRODUCTION
Extcalc is a scientific graphic calculator for linux. It can process difficult
mathmatical functions, draw graphs and work with functions. You can also calculate tables from functions. A Script-Interpreter for programs, written in a C-like language, is also included in Extcalc. 




2. INSTALLATION
- unpack archive (tar -xzf extcalc-0.9.3.tar.gz)
- switch to directory (cd extcalc-0.9.3)
- run configure (cmake .)
- compile (make)
- become root (su)
- install (make install)

4. VERSION
Version 0.9.3

This is a beta release.
For information, how to report a bug, please visit the
project home page http://extcalc-linux.sourceforge.net/.

Due to major changes in the user interface codes, parts
of the user interface are not accessible in v0.9.3 of Extcalc.

done:
User Interface for Calculator
User Interface for Graphics
parser for calculations
drawing graphs (cartesian an polar coordinate system)
working with graphs
integration, differentiation
base-n calculations
logic functions
3D-graphs
dynamic graphs
tables
scripting functions
script editor
script console
script debug messages
zooming and moving graphs
draw into graphics window
save screenshots of graphics window
complex numbers
matrix calculation
vector calculation
script commands for file usage and graphics
window for matrix- and vector-operations

beta test




5. IMPORTANT

This is a beta version. The program may have some bugs.

Tested Distributions:
Suse Linux 11.2        ok
Debian Lenny           ok
Mandriva 2010          ok
Fedora Core 12         ok
Ubuntu Linux 9.10      ok

Software Requirements:
Linux
GCC 4
QT4.3 or higher
OpenGL
cmake


Hardware Requirements:
CPU at about 1GHz (32Bit or 64Bit)
enough RAM to run X
For 3D-graphics, a 3D-graphics card is recommended
A mouse with mousewheel is needed for rotating, moving and zooming graphs


Precision:
The maximal precision of extcalc on a 32Bit-CPU is 18 digits because it uses long double-variables for
calculation.
The precision of integrations is about 9 digits
The precision of differentiations is about 8 digits
At trigonimetric functions and logarithms about 17 digits
